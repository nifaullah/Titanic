# Titanic
Prediction of Survivability using Machine Learning

Data: The Titanic data is a dataset provided by Kaggle publicly - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data . The data set has information about selected the passengers onboard on RMS Titanic which sank after striking an iceberg.

Language: Python 3

Goal: Come up with a classification Model which has highest the accuracy interms of predicting the survivability of passengers.

Approach: Performed extensive feature analysis and feature engineering to create new features and fill out missing values, in particular the age column, applied different classification techniques against the shortlisted features and selected the best classifier based on the cross-validation accuracy.

Major Findings: Random Tree classifier has the best predictive power given the subset of features provided.
